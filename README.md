### Transparency Platform for MGNREGA District Performance ‚Äî Maharashtra  

> Empowering citizens to easily understand how their district is performing under the **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)** using open government data.

---

## üåç Overview

The Government of India provides MGNREGA performance data via an [Open API on data.gov.in](https://www.data.gov.in/catalog/mahatma-gandhi-national-rural-employment-guarantee-act-mgnrega).  
However, most citizens in rural areas cannot access or interpret raw API data.  
This project bridges that gap by offering a **simple, bilingual (English + Marathi)** web dashboard that visualizes district-level MGNREGA performance for **Maharashtra**.
